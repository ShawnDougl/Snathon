# Snathon
I am going to write Snake with Python. This will be my first real coding project in Python.

This project will be useful for me as it helps me to understand Python better. I will write this project on my own, but feel free to leave a hint or comment!

**Credits for this project goes to Geeks For Geeks! I need to dive deeper into code to better understand it, but it was fun to code it from 'scratch'.**
